Previously, the original algorithm used to blur images was far too slow for large test data. Efficient blurring algorithms are very complex. This project has now been revised to utilize Michal Dymel's coding work based off of Ian Kuckir's algorithm for Gaussian blurring. 

Please support Michal Dymel and Ian Kuckir for documenting and explaining this particular algorithm at: http://blog.ivank.net/fastest-gaussian-blur.html  

Also, please support Michal Dymel for coding the algorithm: https://github.com/mdymel/superfastblur

This application comes with test images, to run the program, navigate to:
